# Constructor
**Built:** July 2023 â€“ August 2023

Welcome to **Constructor**, a UWaterloo-themed remake of the popular board game Settlers of Catan. In our console edition of Constructor, four players can compete against one another on a local machine to build, trade, and expand their way up to victory (10 Building Points)!

## Features
- A 19-tile, resource-filled hexagonal game board that can be either randomly generated or manually configured, with built-in saving and loading capabilities;
- Roads and residences (basements, houses, and towers) that can be built and upgraded by players using their resources (BRICK, ENERGY, GLASS, HEAT, WIFI);
- Configurable dice, allowing players to switch between playing with loaded and fair dice on any turn;
- A standard Catan trading system, whereby players can propose and accept/reject offers for trading resources amongst themselves; and
- A goose (i.e., the robber) that can be moved around to block resource acquisition and steal resources from other players.

## Running Unit Tests
All of our unit tests are located in the `tests` folder under the root directory. To run the entire unit test suite, `cd` into `tests` and execute `./run_tests.sh`.
Remember that you may need to grant file permissions to the test execution script with something like `chmod +x run_tests.sh`.
